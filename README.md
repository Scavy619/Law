## Architecture Overview

           Frontend (React)          Admin Panel (React)
                 |                           |
                 +-------------+-------------+
                               |
                      Backend (Express.js)
                       |         |       |
                  MongoDB    Cloudinary  Redis
                       |
              RAG Chatbot (FastAPI)
                       |
               Pinecone Vector DB
               Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
```

- The Frontend and Admin Panel are separate React applications communicating with the Backend via REST APIs.
- The Backend issues short-lived access tokens (sent in the `Authorization` header) and long-lived refresh tokens (stored in HttpOnly cookies). The frontend Axios interceptor silently refreshes access tokens on 401 responses using a queuing mechanism to prevent duplicate refresh calls.
- Redis backs both the global rate limiter (fixed-window, per-IP, 200 requests per 60 seconds across all routes) and the per-route limiter, as well as the per-user chatbot credit counter which auto-expires at midnight.
- The chatbot service is an isolated FastAPI process running on port 4000. The Express backend proxies user messages to it, attaching a shared `RAG_SECRET_KEY` header. The chatbot validates this key before processing any request.
- Conversation history is persisted in MongoDB and the last 10 messages are forwarded to the RAG pipeline on each request to maintain conversational context.
- All sensitive credentials are environment-based with no hardcoded secrets.

---

## Authentication and Security Model

- Stateless JWT authentication with two-token architecture
- Access tokens are short-lived and transmitted via the `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Refresh tokens are long-lived and stored exclusively in HttpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
- Refresh tokens are stored in the database and invalidated on logout or account deletion
- Email verification is required before full platform access
- TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication using the `otpauth` library; setup delivers a QR code and a manual base32 key; a 2-window delta is accepted to tolerate clock skew
- Brute-force protection on TOTP verification using Redis-backed attempt counters
- Password hashing with bcrypt (salted)
- Zod schema validation on all sensitive request bodies
- Role-based access control enforced via three separate middleware guards: `authUser`, `authLawyer`, `authAdmin`
- MongoDB operator injection prevention via `express-mongo-sanitize`
- HTTP security headers via Helmet
- CORS restricted to an explicit allowlist (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env variable); non-origin requests blocked in production
- Global Redis-backed rate limiter: 200 requests per 60 seconds per IP across all routes
- Per-route rate limiter available for sensitive endpoints (e.g. login, 2FA verification)
- Chatbot service protected by a shared `RAG_SECRET_KEY` validated on every request

---

## Chatbot Credit System

Each user is allocated 10 chatbot queries per day. Credits are tracked in two places simultaneously:

- Redis: a per-user key (`credits:<userId>`) auto-expires at midnight using a TTL calculated to the next 00:00:00
- MongoDB: `credits.remaining` on the User document, decremented atomically with Redis and reset on the next day's first request

When credits are exhausted, the backend returns HTTP 403 with a `daily credit limit` message. The frontend Axios interceptor catches this and permanently disables the chat input for the session with a persistent toast notification.

---

## Document Upload & Hybrid RAG Flow

The platform supports a comprehensive document analysis flow, allowing users to query their own uploaded legal documents alongside the platform's core legal knowledge base:

### Document Upload Pipeline

1. **Frontend → Backend (Document Selection)**
   - User selects a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or image) on the frontend
   - Backend performs validation: file extension, size limit (10MB), and daily upload limit (5 documents/day)
   - Original file is stored securely on Cloudinary with user-specific folder structure
   - File metadata is saved in MongoDB with status tracking

2. **Backend → Python Chatbot API (Processing Request)**
   - Backend forwards file to `POST /upload-document` with `user_id`, `filename`, `cloudinary_url`, and `file_bytes`
   - Request authenticated via shared `secure_key` header

3. **Python Pipeline (Document Ingestion)**
   - **Detection:** Identifies file type (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Image)
   - **Extraction:** 
     - PDF: PyPDF2/pypdf page-by-page extraction
     - DOCX: python-docx paragraph extraction
     - TXT: Direct UTF-8 reading
     - Images: Pillow + pytesseract OCR
   - **Chunking:** RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
   - **Embedding & Storage:** Chunks vectorized with Google gemini-embedding-001 and stored in Pinecone user-specific namespace (`user-uploads-{user_id}`)
   - Returns success response with chunk count and namespace

### Hybrid RAG Query Flow

4. **Chat Flow (Multi-Source Q&A)**
   - User submits question with selected mode: `knowledge-base`, `user-uploads`, or `both`
   - Backend forwards to `POST /chat` with `mode`, `user_id`, `message`, and conversation `history`
   - Python API performs parallel retrieval:
     - **knowledge-base mode:** Queries `__default__` namespace (platform legal documents)
     - **user-uploads mode:** Queries `user-uploads-{user_id}` namespace (user's documents)
     - **both mode:** Merges results from both namespaces
   - Top 3 most similar chunks retrieved per namespace using cosine similarity
   - Combined context + last 10 messages + current question sent to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Model generates response with source attribution

5. **Response Delivery**
   - Answer returned to user with Markdown formatting
   - Citations indicate source: platform knowledge base vs user uploads
   - Conversation saved to MongoDB with timestamps

---

## RAG Pipeline (Core Knowledge Base)

The chatbot service implements a core Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline:

1. PDF documents from the `chatbot/data/` directory are loaded page-by-page using `PyPDFLoader` with source filename metadata tagging.
2. Documents are chunked using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with a chunk size of 1000 characters and an overlap of 200 characters.
3. Chunks are embedded using Google `gemini-embedding-001` (3072 dimensions) and stored in a Pinecone serverless index (cosine similarity, AWS us-east-1).
4. The embedding upload pipeline processes batches of 25 chunks, enforces a 1-second delay between batches, retries on HTTP 429 with exponential backoff (up to 5 retries), stops immediately on daily quota exhaustion, and persists batch progress to `progress.json` for resumable uploads.
5. At query time, the top 3 most similar chunks are retrieved from Pinecone using similarity search.
6. The retrieved context, the last 10 messages of conversation history, and the current question are combined into a structured prompt and sent to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.
7. The prompt instructs the model to answer strictly from context when relevant, fall back to general Indian legal guidance when not, avoid referencing the context or system prompt, and use Markdown formatting when detailed output is requested.
8. For recency-sensitive questions, the chatbot additionally performs a Tavily web search and injects recent web context into the prompt before generation.

## Advanced Backend Features & Security

### Background Processing with BullMQ
The backend utilizes **BullMQ** and **Redis** for handling asynchronous background jobs:
- **Video Call Auto-Termination:** `videoWorker` automatically ends video calls when appointment time expires
- **Job Scheduling:** Calls scheduled to end at `slotEnd + 10 minutes` with automatic status updates and duration calculation
- **Job Lifecycle Tracking:** QueueEvents monitor job completion and failures with detailed logging
- **Graceful Handling:** Failed jobs logged for debugging; completed jobs update appointment records atomically

### Robust Authentication & Security
- **OAuth2 & OIDC**: Secure Google login implemented using PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) with:
  - State parameter for CSRF protection
  - Code verifier and challenge stored in secure HttpOnly cookies
  - One-time code exchange mechanism to securely pass tokens to frontend
  - Automatic account creation for new Google users
  - Prevention of password-based login for Google-authenticated accounts
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Passwordless login via time-limited email tokens (15-minute expiry, single-use)
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: TOTP-based 2FA with:
  - QR code and manual key setup
  - 2-window delta for clock skew tolerance
  - Brute-force protection via Redis attempt counters
  - Password confirmation required for disabling
- **Security Middleware**: 
  - Global rate limiting: 200 requests/60s per IP across all routes
  - Route-specific rate limiting for sensitive endpoints (login, 2FA, magic link)
  - `helmet` for secure HTTP headers
  - `express-mongo-sanitize` for NoSQL injection prevention
  - CORS restricted to explicit allowlist
- **Data Privacy**: 
  - Secure account deletion with OTP verification
  - User chat data export capability
  - Per-user document isolation via Pinecone namespaces
